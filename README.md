## General info
FlyHigh is my first web application created to practice JavaScript and AJAX requests.

It allows a user to enter a city of his choice and find the data about top attractions and current weather in the input city, as well as coronavirus situation in dedicated country.
In addition, the aplication includes a simple flight search engine, which allows to find the best flights offers from selected origin.

Application was created using the following APIs: OpenWeatherMap API, Foursquare Places API, Coronavirus COVID19 API and Amadeus API.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* JS (ES6, AJAX - fetch API)
* HTML
* CSS

## Sources
This application was initially inspired by 'Wanderlust' project from Codecademy.
